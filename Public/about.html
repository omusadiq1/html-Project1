<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am an experienced professional with a strong background in logistics, office management, and business operations. Originally from Afghanistan, I have been living in the United States since 2022 with my wife and two children. I founded Onab LLC, where I apply my entrepreneurial mindset and leadership skills. Currently, I am also advancing my expertise in web development, aiming to combine technology with business to create impactful solutions. My diverse skill set allows me to adapt quickly, manage complex challenges, and contribute effectively to any team or project.‚Äù</p>
